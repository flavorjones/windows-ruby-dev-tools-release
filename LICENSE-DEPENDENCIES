  This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express
  or implied.  In no event shall Info-ZIP or its contributors be held liable
  for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
  arising out of the use of or inability to use this software.
  
  Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
  including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
  freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:
  
      1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
         the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
         of conditions.
  
      2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
         must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
         and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
         provided with the distribution.  The sole exception to this condition
         is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as
         part of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion
         of this license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed
         from the binary or disabled.
  
      3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
         systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
         modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
         versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
         be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
         compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
         be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
         limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
         (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
         capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
         explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
         prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
         e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
         will provide support for the altered versions.
  
      4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
         "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
         own source and binary releases.
